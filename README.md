Repository of the iOS and Android App `Fortune`.

Fortune is a small react-native app that helps you keep track of all 
your assets and liabilities. It is free, without ads, fully offline
and does not include any cookies or other annoying stuff. All of your
data stays on your phone.

The full source code is shared in this repository.

## Further Info
I created this app to have a simple tool to know what I own and to
extend my react-native knowledge. Currently I am not planning to
release the app in the Apple App Store, as I dont want to spend the
money for an apple developer account subscription.
